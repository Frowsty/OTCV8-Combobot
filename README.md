# OTCV8-Combobot

This repository contains the Combobot script that I released on OTClient.net
This script is provided as a learning utility for people interested in lua scripting for the otcv8 client.
Contributions are welcome however any contribution has to be well documented and explained in the code.

# How to use the script

  - Click "Join Combo Team" Make sure the leader is in range to invite you to party
  - Change your spell and runeID for battles
  - Enable Combobot and have fun in wars :)

  - Create an access key by entering some random numbers in the access key textbox (ONLY NUMBERS)
  - Choose what hotkey to use for combo command
